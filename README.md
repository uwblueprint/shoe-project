## Setup frontend

The frontend uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and bundles assets using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

Navigate into the UI folder.
```bash
cd ui
```

Run yarn to install deps.
```bash
yarn
```

Run yarn watch to start building development assets. This will not run it's own server, you will instead need to run the go server to view the assets.
```bash
yarn watch
```

To run the UI assets on it's own server, run:
```bash
yarn start
```
